## Case one

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

A very astute observer questioned a finding on chest radiography.

A CT was subsequently obtained.

### Imaging

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/PA-1.jpg){width="95%"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
<br> <br>

Discuss...
:::
:::

### Explanation

The lesion was removed and is an [*Ectopic Thymoma*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6949883/).

A solitary *solid* lesion in this location is a conundrum. It's not a typical location for an enlarged lymph node, for example.

It may be impossible to precisely determine its origin, for example, mediastinum or pleural membrane.

<br>

``` default
A thymoma typically develops in the retrosternal, anterior mediastinum — except when it doesn't!
```

<!----------------------------- CLOSE PANELSET ----------------------------->
:::

## Case two

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

An observer noticed rightward deviation of the trachea on chest radiography and an abnormal right mediastinal-lung interface.

A CT was performed.

### CT

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
Hint: There is no differential diagnosis.

![](images/CT-2a.jpg){width="100%"}
:::
:::

### Explanation

This is typical of intra-thoracic extension of a goiter --- from the left thyroid lobe in this instance.

It demonstrates an admixture of regions of relatively high attenuation --- iodine-containing tissue --- and low attenuation. The latter may be attributed to processes of "degeneration": cystic regions; prior hemorrhage; fibrotic regions.

Dystrophic calcifications are present --- common in multinodular goiter.

<br>

``` default
A diagnosis -- ectopic thyroid tissue -- may be made even if there is no connection with a thyroid lobe.
```

<!----------------------------- CLOSE PANELSET ----------------------------->
:::

## Case three

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

Chest radiography was performed for chest discomfort.

Review the imaging and then...

Address the following questions one at a time in your response:

<br>

::: incremental
-   Where is the abnormality located ? <br>
-   Offer a (limited!) Differential Diagnosis <br>
-   What single imaging procedure will be most informative ?
:::

### Imaging

![](images/CXR-3.jpg){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

### Explanation

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   The presence of the *hilum overlay* sign permits the localization of the lesion to the posterior, paraspinal mediastinum.
-   A mass arising from the posterior pleura (such as a solitary fibrous tumor) may produce the same findings.
-   A pulmonary mass of this size would very likely displace adjacent pulmonary vessels.

<!----------------------------- CLOSE PANELSET ----------------------------->
:::

## Case four

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

A CTPA performed for possible acute pulmonary embolism did not show emboli.

Again, address the following one at a time in your response:

<br>

::: incremental
-   What is present ?

-   Offer a limited Differential Diagnosis.

-   Dare to offer a (confident!) diagnosis.
:::

### CT

![](images/CT-4.jpg){fig-align="center"}

### Explanation

::: columns
::: {.column width="54%"}
Diagnosis: *Paraganglioma*

-   a para-aortic mediastinal mass is present
-   intense contrast-enhancement^1^ of it---except in its center---is present

<br>

``` default
Key points  

- mediastinal paragangliomas usually originate from 
para-aortic (middle mediastinum) and para-vertebral
(posterior mediastinum) sympathetic chain ganglia  

- most are not "functioning" lesions  

- they are typically very vascular tumors
```

## Case five

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

This CT was performed in a 35-year-old male with acute, central chest pain. He is convinced he is having a heart attack

A high-sensitivity troponin assay is "negative."

Review the CT and address the following one at a time in your response:

<br>

::: incremental
-   What finding is not present ?

-   What finding is present ?

-   Offer a certain explanation for the pain.
:::

### CT

<br>

![](images/CT-5.jpg)

### Explanation

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Diagnosis: *Spontaneous (sporadic) necrosis of mediastinal fat*.

-   the location in this case is typical
-   a small pleural effusion is present, a common concurrent finding
-   this is analogous to the entity of *epiploic appendagitis* in the abdomen

## Case six

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

A CTPA in a 45-year-old woman did not reveal pulmonary emboli.

Something unexpected was perceived.

What ?

What is a sufficient explanation ?

If you could see the patient, you would observe this:

### CTPA

<br>

![](images/CT-6.jpg){fig-align="center"}

### Explanation

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Diagnosis: *True Thymic Hyperplasia*

-   substantial thymic tissue is present, *without* rounded, mass-like morphology [⟶]{style="color: red"}
-   a known association with Grave's disease.
-   further evaluation with chemical-shift MRI (to establish the presence of internal fat) is not usually necessary
-   aberrant origin of the right subclavian artery is an unrelated finding

## Case seven

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

Persistent chest pain in a 28-year-old patient.

### Radiography

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   describe the findings

-   where is the abnormality located ?

-   provide a limited differential diagnosis

-   if this were a male instead, what should be further evaluated by means of physical exam and an ultrasound as part of the work-up?

Findings on radiography

-   [the opacity effaces normal left supra-azygos (right paratracheal) and left supra-aortic mediastinal-lung interfaces; the distal aortic arch (knob) is not effaced]{style="font-size: 28px;"}
-   [the trachea is narrowed]{style="font-size: 28px;"}
-   [thus substantial superior and anterior mediastinal tumor mass is present, traversing the thoracic inlet]{style="font-size: 28px;"}
-   [a lymphoma is by far the most likely explanation; a primary or metastatic germ cell tumor is a consideration---in a male, a scrotal examination and testicular ultrasound should be performed]{style="font-size: 28px;"}

<!----------------------------- CLOSE PANELSET ----------------------------->
:::

## Case eight

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

An abnormal opacity was perceived on frontal chest radiography---in the right-cardiophrenic region effacing the usual lateral margin of the inferior right atrium.

A CT was performed.

The radiograph is not available for review.

### CT

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
-   describe the findings

What is *the* diagnosis ?

(A differential diagnosis is not relevant.)

::: {.column width="70%"}
![](images/CT-8.jpg){width="100%" fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

### Explanation

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Findings

-   ascites is present [a]{style="color: red"}
-   a small hemidiaphragm defect is present at the Foramen of Morgagni [⟶]{style="color: red"}
-   ascitic fluid has passed through this defect to accumulate in a hernia sac at the right cardiophrenic angle

## Case nine

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

The patient complained of mild chest pain at a post-operative clinic visit. A mediastinoscopy (to biopsy right paratracheal and ? subcarinal nodes) was performed three weeks before.

He does not have a fever.

### CT

-   describe the findings

-   provide a very limited Differential Diagnosis -- if you can!

### CT-zoomed

![](images/CT-9-zoomed.jpg){width="60%" fig-align="center"}

### Explanation

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Findings

-   small amounts of fluid are present in the mediastinum in the lower pre-tracheal...
-   and subcarinal mediastinum, where a tiny amount of gas is present [⟶]{style="color: red"}
-   the findings suggest the possibility of post-procedure infection...
-   unless you become aware that the surgeon packed this area with [Surgicel® Fibrillar](https://www.jnjmedtech.com/en-US/product/surgicel-fibrillar-absorbable-hemostat) as a hemostatic agent. It holds onto fluid and air for some time.

Go figure...It's a gotcha!

### Presentation

This is an employer-mandated, pre-employment radiograph.

Offer one---very likely---diagnosis.

### Radiograph

### Explanation

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

### Presentation

This patient reports dysphagia of yearslong duration.

Describe the findings and suggest the most likely diagnosis.

What (old-fashioned) procedure would you suggest to verify your diagnosis ?

### Radiograph

![](images/CXR-11.jpg){width="60%" fig-align="center"}

### Explanation

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Yes, the findings are subtle!

## Case twelve

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

This patient is asymptomatic at present.

The CT was done after someone described an abnormality on a radiographic examination.

### Imaging

![](images/CXR-12.jpg){width="100%"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/CT-12.jpg){width="100%"}

Is there really a differential diagnosis ?
:::
:::

### Explanation

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Most-relevant finding: The para-cardiac lesion is a water-containing structure [w]{style="color: red"}

This, and its location, enables a confident diagnosis: *Pericardial cyst*

They may occur on the left side also!

It it were located in the retro-sternal, anterior mediastinum, describe it as a *Thymic cyst*.

### Explanation

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Findings

-   on radiography, it's hard to know whether it's in the lung or mediastinum
-   the key finding on CT is the presence of intra-lesional fat [f]{style="color: red"}
-   this lesion typically manifests on CT as a heterogeneous anterior mediastinal mass containing soft-tissue, fluid, fat, or calcium/bone, or any combination of the four
-   the location in this case is, of course, unusual
