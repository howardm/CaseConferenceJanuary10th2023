## Case one

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

A very astute observer questioned a finding on chest radiography.

A CT was subsequently obtained.

### Imaging

## Case two

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

An observer noticed rightward deviation of the trachea on chest radiography and an abnormal right mediastinal-lung interface.

A CT was performed.



### CT

## Case three

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

Chest radiography was performed for chest discomfort.

Review the imaging and then...

Address the following questions one at a time in your response:

<br>

::: incremental
-   Where is the abnormality located ? <br>
-   Offer a (limited!) Differential Diagnosis <br>
-   What single imaging procedure will be most informative ?
:::

<!----------------------------- CLOSE PANELSET ----------------------------->
:::

## Case four

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

A CTPA performed for possible acute pulmonary embolism did not show emboli.

Again, address the following one at a time in your response:

<br>

::: incremental
-   What is present ?

-   Offer a limited Differential Diagnosis.

-   Dare to offer a (confident!) diagnosis.
:::

### CT

![](images/CT-4.jpg){fig-align="center"}

<!----------------------------- CLOSE PANELSET ----------------------------->
:::

## Case five

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

This CT was performed in a 35-year-old male with acute, central chest pain. He is convinced he is having a heart attack

A high-sensitivity troponin assay is "negative."

Review the CT and address the following one at a time in your response:

<br>

::: incremental
-   What finding is not present ?

-   What finding is present ?

-   Offer a certain explanation for the pain.
:::

### CT

## Case six

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

A CTPA in a 45-year-old woman did not reveal pulmonary emboli.

Something unexpected was perceived.

What ?

What is a sufficient explanation ?

If you could see the patient, you would observe this:

### CTPA

<!----------------------------- CLOSE PANELSET ----------------------------->

## Case seven

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

Persistent chest pain in a 28-year-old patient.

### Radiography

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   describe the findings

-   where is the abnormality located ?

-   provide a limited differential diagnosis

-   if this were a male instead, what should be further evaluated by means of physical exam and an ultrasound as part of the work-up?

## Case eight

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

An abnormal opacity was perceived on frontal chest radiography---in the right-cardiophrenic region effacing the usual lateral margin of the inferior right atrium.

A CT was performed.

The radiograph is not available for review.

### CT

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
-   describe the findings

What is *the* diagnosis ?

(A Differential Diagnosis is not relevant.)
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}

<!----------------------------- CLOSE PANELSET ----------------------------->

## Case nine

::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

The patient complained of mild chest pain at a post-operative clinic visit. A mediastinoscopy (to biopsy right paratracheal and ? subcarinal nodes) was performed three weeks before.

He does not have a fever.

### CT

-   describe the findings

-   provide a very limited Differential Diagnosis -- if you can!

## Case ten
::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

This is an employer-mandated, pre-employment radiograph.

Offer one---very likely---diagnosis.

### Radiograph

<!----------------------------- CLOSE PANELSET ----------------------------->
:::

## Case eleven
::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

This patient reports dysphagia of years-long duration.

Describe the findings and suggest the most likely diagnosis.

What (old-fashioned) procedure would you suggest to verify your diagnosis ?

### Radiograph

## Case twelve
::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

This patient is asymptomatic at present.

The CT was done after someone described an abnormality on a radiographic examination.

### Imaging

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/CXR-12.jpg){width="100%"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/CT-12.jpg){width="100%"}

Is there really a Differential Diagnosis ?

## Case thirteen
::: panel-tabset
### Presentation

The patient reports chest pain of several months' duration.

### Radiography

![](images/CXR-13.jpg){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

### CT

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Share your thoughts.

Be bold and suggest one confident diagnosis.

It's the last case!
